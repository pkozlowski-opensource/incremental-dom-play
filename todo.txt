ALGORITHM
-----------------------------------
- better understand on how I can take advantage of the creation mode knowledge
- what happens with sibiling nodes?
- how would I go about the "refresh" functionality?

IMPL
-----------------------------------
-

PERF (ideas to test)
-----------------------------------
- pass a create / update function to the createOrUpdateNode (this will eliminate if / else on type)
- change generated code signature so I'm passing around objects ready to insert into VDOM
- use byte-masking for type instead of strings (will result in an additional field in VDOM)
- have different VDOM node types to save memory (this will make those polymorphic, although still a limited set)
- cache cursors
- attribute / property / class / style split: [attr.foo]="exp", [class.foo]="exp", [style.foo]="exp", [foo]="exp"
- create different methods for elements (with / without properties etc.) => there would be many combinations!

FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------------------------
- refresh / refreshAll
- attribute / property split
